# Introduction 
Layout setup for recording when different numbers of clips (up to 5) and a shared screen are present.
This repo generates 5-second FFmpeg-based layout previews to visualize how clips will be arranged in a video session where participants may dynamically join, leave, or share their screen.

# Prerequisite 
- FFmpeg should be installed

# Commands
- ```npm init -y```
- ```npm install --save-dev @types/node```
- ```node index.ts```
